Today was a big treat -- my neighborhood friend Yolanda took me shopping all around the city center area near the big cathedral in downtown Guadalajara.

There are so many stores for everything you can imagine.  There's even a building the size of Sears or Penney's, multiple floors, that is full, full, full of nothing but jewelry shops.  Lots of police all around that one -- with big dogs, beautiful Belgian Malinois.

We wandered through the huge multi-story market with stalls and stalls of everything from cow feet and ankles to veggies to little birds to clothing and purses and toys and pink guitars in green cases to mariachi suits adult to baby size.  I really don't know how <img src="https://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/560219_10150977897493993_677503992_11925392_494293446_n.jpg" alt="" width="150" align="right" /> you would cook a cow hoof with about 10 inches of leg, but apparently somebody does.  And I have a local friend who loves to eat chicken feet that are sold everywhere you buy chicken.

I bought a nice leather belt for Glenn for 180 pesos ($13.02) and Yo bought some little purses to give as gifts on her trip back to Canada in a couple of weeks.

I also bought a cotton skirt that I didn't really want that bad, but she kept coming down on the price.  It wasn't the price I objected to but finally I felt I had to buy it.  It will be great in the beach heat though.  Not $250 pesos ($18.08) but 190 pesos ($13.74).

We had lunch at Yo's favorite restaurant downtown, El Mexicano, and arrachera that was really good, though not as good as the one we had in Tlaquepaque.  It's thin flank steak, marinated and cooked to tender perfection.  So good!  We have it wherever we go and judge each restaurant on it.<img src="https://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/582389_10150977896943993_677503992_11925390_900779950_n.jpg" alt="" width="175" align="right" />

So amazingly I bought eight major clothing items and spent a whopping $89.69 US.  Do that in Dallas!
