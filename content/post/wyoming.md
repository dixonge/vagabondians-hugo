On the last day of August we packed up, cranked down the camper, hitched 'er up and took off for our final trip through Yellowstone. Our route took us almost directly through the middle of the park and out the east gate. We proceeded east all the way to Cody, Wyoming, about 130 miles away. We got into town and set up camp and then Bryn contacted Deb, a classmate from high school!

She jumped on her scooter and her hubbie Mike got on his Harley and they came over for a visit. The next day after they got off work we met up and went to their favorite restaurant in town for some great wine and excellent food! The next morning we packed up again and took off for northern Minnesota, via Montana and North Dakota!
