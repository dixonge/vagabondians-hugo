<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Mexican traditional celebration of the Day of the Dead is coming up! <a title="Day of the Dead altar 1" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/48315294@N00/10578783206/" rel=""><img class="aligncenter" title="Day of the Dead altar 1" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2822/10578783206_48842d9ee9.jpg" alt="Day of the Dead altar 1" width="500" height="375" /></a></span>

<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Altars to the dearly departed are going up everywhere, homes, shops, public buildings. We are in one of our favorite restaurants this morning, and the altar here is being built and the entire floor is covered with pine needles. As the story goes, the spirits are invited back to celebrate and honor the lives they lead, and families and friends celebrate at home and in the cemeteries with laughing, eating, singing, even Mariachi bands. Offerings are placed on elaborate altars. </span>
