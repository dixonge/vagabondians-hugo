So after we left Belize we flew back to Texas. We are here visiting friends and family for a bit, and trying to finish up some projects.

Bryn is doing a lot of homework in preparation for her TEFL certificate so that she can teach English somewhere. She is thinking that it will be nice to have a reason to get out of the casa, meet new people and make a little money at the same time.

Glenn is still working on our first book, and is also working on a major site overhaul (you may have noticed some things changing around here) and thinks he may have come up with a new way of telling our stories that we hope you will enjoy. Here is a little sample for you from a recent weekend with some friends -- hope you enjoy!

[UPDATE: The 'new way' of telling stories is a site that no longer exists. The link below now leads to a post right here on Vagabondians...]
